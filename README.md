# principled-markovian-transformer

A hybrid sequential modeling architecture that bridges probabilistic Markovian dynamics with attention-based Transformers through a theoretically grounded Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion.

ðŸ”‘ Key Contributions

Multi-Expert Transition Module (METM): Specialized experts capture short-, medium-, long-range, and global temporal patterns.

Data-Dependent Routing: Adaptive MoE routing dynamically selects experts based on input characteristics, ensuring load balancing.

Principled Fusion Architecture: Conflict-aware integration of Markovian transitions and self-attention with formal convergence guarantees.

Theoretical Foundations: Formal proofs for convergence rates, universal approximation properties, and complexity bounds.

State-of-the-Art Performance:

RULER: 94.2% average accuracy (+5.1 over Jamba)

InfiniBench: 89.7% accuracy on 100K+ token tasks

35% memory efficiency improvement over standard Transformers at 64K sequences.
